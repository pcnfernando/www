Siddhi understands Streaming SQL queries in order to capture events from diverse data sources, process them, integrate with multiple services and data sources, and publish output to various endpoints in real-time. Distributions Kubernetes Docker VM (Binary) Java Python Source Graphical Editor Source Editor Benefits Faster Development Agile development experience with SQL like query language and graphical drag-and-drop editor supporting event simulation. Cloud Native Lightweight runtime that natively runs in Kubernetes via Kubernetes CRD, and works with systems such as NATS, gRPC, and Prometheus. Scalable Deployment Embedded event processing within Java, Python applications to running on bare metal, Docker and massively scaling on Kubernetes. System Integration Integrates with messaging systems (NATS, Kafka, JMS), Databases (RDBMS, NoSQL), Services (HTTP, gRPC), File systems and others. CI/CD Pipeline Supports development lifecycle and seamless deployments, through simple file-based configurations, automated tests, and CI/CD pipelines. Reliability Battle-tested with billions of events at UBER, eBay, PayPal, HCA, TFL, WSO2 and in many Fortune 500 companies enabling exactly once event processing. Overview Siddhi can run as an embedded Java or Python library, run as a microservice on bare-metal, VM, or Docker, and run natively at scale in Kubernetes processing millions of events per second. Use cases Streaming Data Integration Retrieve and publish data from various enterprise systems. Perform data transformation on JSON, XML, Text, Avro, and CSV. Integrate with databases, services, and realtime event streams. Data preprocessing, fault tolerance, and error handling. Streaming Data Analytics Calculate aggregations over time, length, and session windows. Long-running time-series aggregations from seconds to years. Analyze event occurrence patterns and trends over time. Realtime predictions with online and pre-trained ML models. Alerts & Notifications Generate alerts based on static and dynamic thresholds. Correlate data to detect event anomalies and missing events. Support scheduling, digest, and auto-retry of notifications. Publish alerts via various event sinks such as email, and MQs. Adaptive Decision Making Static rule processing via predefined and database based rules. Dynamic rule processing through stateful queries and system state. Decision making through synchronous RPC (HTTP, gRPC). Incremental learning and decision making online ML models.

Code Commit Guidelines \u00b6 We follow these commit message guidelines: Separate subject from body with a blank line Limit the subject line to 50 characters Capitalize the subject line Do not end the subject line with a period Use the imperative mood in the subject line Wrap the body at 72 characters Use the body to explain what and why vs. how Please find details at: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ Accepting Contributor License Agreement (CLA) \u00b6 Before you submit your first contribution please accept our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). When you send your first Pull Request (PR), GitHub will ask you to accept the CLA. There is no need to do this before you send your first PR. Subsequent PRs will not require CLA acceptance. If for some (unlikely) reason at any time CLA changes, you will get presented with the new CLA text on your first PR after the change. Proposing Changes or Improvements \u00b6 You can propose changes or improvements by reporting an issue in the Siddhi GitHub repository with the label type/improvement or type/new-feature .
